This is a simple example created to show the evolution of a delegate from C#
1 / 1.1 right up to the modern lambda expression. 

It's probably worth noting that if you aren't familiar with lambda expressions in 
C# you aren't familiar with modern C# (i.e. >= 3). It will also make mocking a rather
difficult and miserable proposition.

Console.WriteLine("Clank! The coin was rejected");
